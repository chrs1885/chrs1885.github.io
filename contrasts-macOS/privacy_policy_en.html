         In the following, we would like to inform you about the purposes, type and
         scope of the processing of your personal data while using the Contrasts
         App for macOS (hereinafter also referred to as the "App"). The legal basis for the
         level of data protection within the App is the Regulation (EU) 2016/679
         (GDPR).
      </p>
      <h2>1. Responsible body</h2>
      <p>Responsible for the processing of personal data within the app is:</p>
      <p>
         Christoph Wendt<br />
         Gerwigstra√üe 36<br />
         76131 Karlsruhe

      </p>
      <h2>2. Overview of the data processing within the app</h2>
      <p>
         The app allows you to create color pairs and determine their contrast to
         each other and thus the legibility.
      </p>
      <p>
         When using the app, the data processing that takes place can be divided
         into three main categories:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            When you download the app, the necessary information is transferred to
            the Apple App Store.
         </li>
         <li>
            In order to enable functions of the app (e.g. splitting of created
            colour pairs), the app needs access to various functions of your mobile
            device (e.g. saving in picture gallery).
         </li>
         <li>
            In the course of using the App, various information is collected. This
            is pseudonymized data, for example, to create usage statistics or error
            reports in order to improve our app.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>3. Installation of the Contrasts app</h2>
      <p>
         The Contrasts app is available through the App Store operated by Apple
         Inc. The download may require prior registration with the App Store and
         installation of the App Store software. We have no control over the
         collection and processing of your personal information in connection with
         registering and providing downloads from the App Store. Apple Inc. as the
         operator of the App Store is solely responsible in this respect.
      </p>
      <p>
         For more information on this data processing, please refer to the App
         Store Privacy Policy:

      <h2>4. Use of our app</h2>
      <h3>4.1 Purposes of data processing / legal basis</h3>
      <p>The following data is collected when the app is called up:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>

            language, etc.) from which you started the app,
         </li>
         <li>the IP address of the mobile device,</li>
         <li>the date and time of access,</li>
         <li>the app version used.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         This data is temporarily stored in a log file for the following purposes:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>error analysis,</li>
         <li>improvement of the App.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         The legal basis for the above-mentioned data processing is based on Art. 6
         para. 1 letter f) GDPR.
      </p>
      <h3>4.2 Required authorisations</h3>
      <p>
         In order for our app to function properly, it is necessary for you to
         allow and grant access to certain functions of your terminal device. You will be prompted
         to grant the appropriate access authorization once at the beginning or
         when you use the respective function.
      </p>
      <h4>Network access &amp; connections</h4>
      <p>
         An Internet connection is only required when sending crash reports and
         usage statistics.
      </p>
      <h4>Other device functions or device sensors</h4>
      <p>
         You can send color pairs you have created to other people. A system dialog
         will appear where you can share your content (e.g. via contacts, e-mail,
         social media). A data processing by us as well as a transmission of the
         contact data to us does not take place.
      </p>
      <h4>Feedback function via e-mail</h4>
      <p>
         If you want to give us feedback, you can do so via the e-mail form within
         the app. We ask you not to send any further personal data of you or other
         persons within the feedback function to us. The legal basis for data
         processing within the framework of the feedback function is Art. 6 para. 1
         lit. a) GDPR. Your feedback messages will be deleted after 4 weeks.
      </p>
      <h4>Usage statistics & Error reports</h4>
      <p>
         System-side usage statistics and error reports can be collected via Apple Inc. This system setting is not specific to the Contrasts App and can be deactivated in the device settings.
      </p>
      <h2>5. Linked websites</h2>
      <p>
         Provided that for the display of contents (e.g. licenses, privacy policy) 
         browser and you call up further links there, your personal data 
         links, your personal data will be processed on these websites in 
         processed in deviation to this privacy policy. This privacy policy only applies to our App. We ask you to

         (Art. 18 GDPR) of your personal data.

         transfer in accordance with Art. 20 GDPR.<br />
